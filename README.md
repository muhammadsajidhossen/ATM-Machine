# ATM-Machine
This Python ATM system handles registration, authentication, transactions, and PIN changes. It secures data in JSON and encrypts PINs with SHA-256. Users have a daily withdrawal limit, transaction history, and three login attempts. A simple interface makes it ideal for learning secure banking operations.
